Models and training data to accompany the paper: Masis, Neal, Green, and O'Connor. ["Corpus-Guided Contrast Sets for Morphosyntactic Feature Detection in Low-Resource English Varieties."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07611) Field Matters Workshop at COLING, 2022.
  
  
  
## TODO
  
  
1. Release training data
    - Training data for IndE and AAE generated via CGEdit method. 
    - Training data for IndE and AAE combining examples generated via ManualGen and via CGEdit.
2. Release 4 trained models (trained on the 4 train sets)
3. Model/training code instructions
    - To be released for reproducibility.
4. Add citation info and link paper

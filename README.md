  ## TODO
  
  
  1. Release training data
      - Training data for IndE and AAE generated via CGEdit method. 
      - Training data for IndE and AAE combining examples generated via ManualGen and via CGEdit.
  2. Release 4 trained models (trained on the 4 train sets)
  3. Model/training code instructions
      - To be released for reproducibility.
